# Virtual Boy manuals
All of these manuals have been scanned and are hosted by Jackall Sasaki at his Hatena Blog. This page only contains links to his scans, translates the game names to English, and add other metadata so people can find them more easily. All credit goes to Sasaki, I'm just a dork with too much time on his hands.
